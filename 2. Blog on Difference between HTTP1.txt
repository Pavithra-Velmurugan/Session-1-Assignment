2. Blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Introduction
The internet's evolution has drastically changed how we access and share information.
One of the fundamental technologies driving this transformation is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). 
Over the years, HTTP has undergone significant updates, with HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 being two prominent versions. 
This blog will explore the key differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, shedding light on how these protocols have improved web performance, security, and efficiency.
HTTP/1.1: The Old Standard
HTTP/1.1, introduced in 1997, served as the primary HTTP version for more than a decade. While it played a crucial role in the development of the World Wide Web, it had its limitations, leading to the need for a more efficient protocol like HTTP/2.
1.	Connection Handling:
•	In HTTP/1.1, each resource (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) required a separate connection to the server. This resulted in a high number of requests and increased latency.
2.	Header Overhead:
•	Every request and response in HTTP
/1.1 carried a significant amount of redundant header information. This contributed to larger payload sizes and slower page loading times.
3.	Blocking Nature:
•	HTTP/1.1 used a blocking approach, where a request had to wait for the previous one to complete. This could lead to a "head-of-line blocking" phenomenon, causing delays.

HTTP/2: The Modern Alternative
HTTP/2, introduced in 2015, was designed to overcome the shortcomings of HTTP/1.1 and adapt to the changing needs of the web. It introduced several crucial improvements:
1.	Multiplexing:
•	HTTP/2 allows multiple requests and responses to be multiplexed over a single connection. This means that multiple resources can be requested and delivered concurrently, reducing latency and improving overall page loading times.
2.	Header Compression:
•	HTTP/2 utilizes header compression techniques like HPACK, which significantly reduces the redundant header data sent with each request

and response. Smaller headers result in smaller payload sizes and faster load times.
3.	Server Push:
•	HTTP/2 introduced the concept of server push, enabling servers to proactively send resources to the client before they are requested. This can further enhance performance by reducing the need for additional round trips.
4.	Stream Prioritization:
•	HTTP/2 allows for the prioritization of streams, ensuring that critical resources are fetched and displayed first, improving user experience.
5.	Security Enhancements:
•	HTTP/2 encourages the use of secure connections (HTTPS) and can only be used with encrypted connections. This helps protect data from eavesdropping and tampering.
HTTP/1.1 vs. HTTP/2: A Comparison
Let's summarize the key differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2:
1.	Connection Handling:
•	HTTP/1.1 uses multiple connections for parallel requests, while HTTP/2 multiplexes requests over a single connection, reducing latency.
2.	Header Overhead:
•	HTTP/1.1 has larger header sizes due to redundancy, whereas HTTP/2 uses header compression, resulting in smaller payloads.
3.	Blocking vs. Non-blocking:
•	HTTP/1.1 employs a blocking approach, leading to potential delays, while HTTP/2 supports non-blocking multiplexing.
4.	Server Push:
•	HTTP/2 allows for server push, enabling proactive resource delivery, which HTTP/1.1 lacks.
5.	Stream Prioritization:
•	HTTP/2 provides stream prioritization for better resource management, while HTTP/1.1 treats all requests equally.
6.	Security:
•	HTTP/2 encourages the use of secure connections (HTTPS), prioritizing user data protection.
Conclusion
In today's fast-paced internet landscape, web performance and user experience are paramount. HTTP/2 was developed to address the limitations of HTTP/1.1 and has since become the preferred choice for modern web applications. Its multiplexing, header compression, and other optimizations have greatly improved web performance, making it an essential upgrade for anyone looking to deliver faster and more efficient web experiences. As technology continues to evolve, it's essential to stay up-to-date with the latest protocols and standards to ensure your web applications remain competitive and user-friendly.
